## 📖 What I Learnt

This app is a work in progress — learnings will be documented as development continues:

- 🏗️ **Flutter App Structure** — Refactored the default boilerplate into a cleaner `App` widget.
- 📱 **UI Design** — Built a responsive authentication screen using `SingleChildScrollView`, `Card`, and `Form` widgets.
- 🔄 **State Management** — Implemented basic local state to toggle between Login and Signup modes.
- 🎨 **Theming** — Customized `ThemeData` with `ColorScheme.fromSeed` to maintain visual consistency.
- 🔥 **Firebase Setup** — Integrated `firebase_core` and `firebase_auth`, initialized Firebase in `main.dart` using platform-specific options.
- 🔐 **Firebase Authentication** — Implemented email/password sign-in and account creation using `FirebaseAuth`, with `FirebaseAuthException` error handling.
- 🔄 **Stream-Based Navigation** — Used `StreamBuilder` with `authStateChanges()` to reactively route users based on authentication state.
- ⏳ **Splash Screen** — Handled `ConnectionState.waiting` from the auth stream to show a loading screen during Firebase initialization.
- 📸 **Image Picker** — Integrated `image_picker` to let users capture a profile photo from the camera during signup, using `ImagePicker().pickImage()` with quality and size constraints.
- ☁️ **Firebase Storage** — Uploaded the selected profile image to Firebase Storage under `user_images/{uid}.jpg` and retrieved the download URL via `getDownloadURL()`.
- ⏺️ **Loading State** — Used an `_isAuthenticating` flag with `setState` to conditionally show a `CircularProgressIndicator` and hide action buttons during auth.
- 🔗 **Callback Pattern** — Passed an `onImagePick` callback from `AuthScreen` into `UserImagePicker` to bubble the selected `File` up to the parent widget.
- 🚪 **Sign Out** — Wired up `FirebaseAuth.instance.signOut()` to an icon button in the chat screen's `AppBar`.
